JMeter Token Extraction Fix

The current issue with the JMeter test is that it's looking for the auth token in the wrong location in the JSON response.

Current JMeter Extractor:
- JSON Path: $.data.token

What Our API Actually Returns:
- JSON Path: $.token

To fix this:

1. Open Sample_test_script2.jmx in JMeter
2. Find the JSONPostProcessor named "Comp Token Extractor"
3. Change the jsonPathExprs from $.data.token to $.token
4. Do the same for any other token extractors in the script

For all other endpoints that require authentication:
1. Make sure they have a HTTP Header Manager
2. Each header manager should include an Authorization header
3. The value should be: Bearer ${compToken}  (or whatever variable name holds your token)

Additional Notes:
- Our auth endpoints now support both "username" and "user_name" formats
- The successful registration and login should now work, but subsequent requests need the token properly passed
